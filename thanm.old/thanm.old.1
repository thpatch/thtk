.Sh BUGS
A few files from TH12 and TH13 contain overlapping entries
with different formats.
Dumping and recreating these archives will not result in the same archives.
The affected pixels seem to all have 0 for alpha though.
.Pp
One of the scripts in TH95's front.anm lack a sentinel instruction.
Dumping and recreating this archive will add a sentinel instruction.
.Pp
This version will not create correct TH19 archives,
please use the latest
.Xr thanm 1
instead.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
File names may not be properly sanitized when extracting.
Furthermode, invalid data may not be properly handled.
