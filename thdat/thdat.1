.Sh CAVEATS
BGM archives are not supported by the
.Nm
utility.
.Sh BUGS
The format used by TH03-TH05 uses separate encryption keys for each entry in the archives, as well as one key for the entry list.
It is not known if these keys are computed from the entries, or if they are randomly assigned.
They are currently set to constant values.
.Pp
Original TH08 and TH09 archives contain a large amount of encrypted zero padding at the end of the entry list.
This padding is reduced to four bytes.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
File names may not be properly sanitized when extracting.
Furthermode, invalid data may not be properly handled.
Do not extract untrusted archives.
