- Allow multiple mnemonics for the same instruction.
- Allow eclmap signatures for timeline instructions.
- The parser grammar has been reworked to be completely unambiguous.
- Control statements now require parenthesis around expressions.
  E.g. if (x) goto y; instead of if x goto y;
- More escape sequences are supported: \r \n \0.
- Unary plus operator added.

  in more places.
- Added #line directive.
- Added insdef statement for defining new instructions.
- Support for TH18, TH185, TH19 has been added.

What's new in thtk 12

What's new in thtk 11
=====================

This release adds thstd, a new tool to dump and recreate the background
scripts found in the *.std files. Further changes to existing tools:

#### thanm
In preparation of thcrap's upcoming support for ANM header patching, more
thorough reverse-engineering went into the various ANM structures.
All previously unknown fields have now been identified and named.
Additionally, index numbers are now dumped for entries and instruction lines,
as this is the only reliable way to address them in an ANM header patch.
Creating new ANM archives from old spec dumps will show backwards-compatibility
warnings to ease the transition to the new, more correct dump format.

Thanks to GhostPhanom for funding this development!

  added as an additional Git submodule.
