Build requirements:
  cmake >=3.0.0
  flex >=2.5.31
  bison
  (optional) pkg-config
  (optional) zlib
  (optional) libpng

Build instructions for Linux(GNU toolchain):
  $ cmake .  # append -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=(directory) if you want to
             # customize the install directory
             # append -DWITH_LIBPNG_SOURCE=OFF if you want to use an installed
             # version of libpng
  $ make
  # make install

Build instructions for Windows(MSVC toolchain):
  1.   Download flex and bison(you can use win-flexbison) and add them to PATH.
  2.   Run cmake-gui, select the source directory(the directory where this
       instruction is located) and the build directory(wherever you want), and
       click `Configure'.
  2-1. You can specify the installation directory(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) after
       the configuration is done.
  3.   Generate build files, and you should be able to find .sln in the build
       directory you specified.
  4.   Open the solution and build.
  4-1. If you want, build the project named `INSTALL'. It will install the
       binaries and headers into the directory you specified at step 2-1.
